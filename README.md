# Espal Store Synthesizer

Espal store synthesizer is a generator tool for the espal-core that will collect all stores currently available and generate all the base code needed, combined with interfacing custom written functionality.

Admittedly this tool was kind of clunked together and isn't really up to par on the best Go coding standards, but it does the job quite well.

More information can be found in the [espal-core documentation](https://github.com/espal-digital-development/espal-core).
